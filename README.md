# First_BSPWM_setup_dotfiles
Dotfiles from my first try of creating my own setup on Manjaro Linux with BSPWM.

To be honest, this is not only my ideas, I used a lot of things from https://github.com/Zproger/bspwm-dotfiles. But there a lot of my work, first of all, setting up my polybar with all needed modules.
